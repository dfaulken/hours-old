# hours

This is a Rails 5.1 app I deploy on a DigitalOcean droplet for tracking my hours worked for PVTA.

It emails our payroll clerk, and my boss, the hours each week in a standard format.

It's secured with basic HTTP authentication.

This was also a way for me to become familiar with some of the cool new features of Rails 5.1:

+ encrypted secrets
+ Yarn
+ parameterized mailers
+ `form_with`

They're pretty awesome.
